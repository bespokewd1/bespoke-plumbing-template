KMS Plumbing & Gasfitting’s New
Website – A Custom Upgrade for a Better Experience!

We’re excited to unveil our newly upgraded website! We partnered
with Bespoke Web Design Edmonton to create a fully custom experience
that reflects our business and services.

Charles from Bespoke reached out at the perfect time—we needed
someone who could handle the upgrade seamlessly, and they delivered
beyond our expectations! But what really stood out? It’s not just a one-time
deal—this is a long-term partnership to help our business grow.

At KMS Plumbing & Gasfitting, we take pride in providing top-quality
service, and our website should showcase that. We moved from a basic
Squarespace site to a fast, high-performance custom website designed
around our business goals and customer needs.

And the best part? The process was easy, hassle-free, and completely
worth it!

### Why We Upgraded – The Benefits of a
Custom Website

We also got Bespoke Web Design’s Brand & Identity Marketing
Package, which includes:

✅ A Fully Custom Website – Built around our vision, not a template.

✅ 5 Personalized Social Media Assets Every Month – Custom graphics
for our promotions & events, so posting is easier while we focus on our
services.

✅ Lightning-Fast & SEO-Friendly – Coded in vanilla
JavaScript using MS Visual Studio Code, making it lightweight and
favored by Google.

✅ A Working Blog – Now we can share plumbing tips for our clients
and readers

✅ Unlimited Edits – We can update content anytime as our business
grows.

✅ Banners for Financing & Coupons – Customers can quickly see
current offers and promotions

What’s even better? Bespoke Web Design Edmonton is a small home-based
Canadian business—if you want to support local entrepreneurs while
getting an affordable, high-quality website with no limitations, they’re
the right choice!

### The Process – Quick & Stress-Free

1️. Free Website Audit

Charles from Bespoke Web Design Edmonton analyzed our old website

The best part? Charles made everything easy to understand without the
tech jargon.

3️. Custom Design, Coded & Launched

The team at Bespoke designed, coded, and deployed our new website—tailored
exactly to our needs, without unnecessary extras.
