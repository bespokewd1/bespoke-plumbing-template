**5 Most Common Plumbing Issues and How to Fix Them**

Plumbing problems can be frustrating, costly, and sometimes unavoidable. However, knowing the most common issues can help you take proactive steps to prevent or address them before they escalate. Here are five of the most frequent plumbing issues homeowners face and what you can do about them.

### 1. **Dripping Faucets**

A dripping faucet might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it can waste a significant amount of water over time, increasing your utility bills. The most common cause is a worn-out washer or O-ring, which can be easily replaced. If the issue persists, it could indicate high water pressure or valve problems that need professional attention.

### 2. **Clogged Drains**

Slow or completely clogged drains are often caused by accumulated grease, hair, soap scum, or debris. Regularly using a drain strainer and avoiding pouring grease down the sink can help prevent clogs. For minor blockages, a plunger or drain snake can be effective. However, persistent clogs may require professional drain cleaning.

### 3. **Running Toilets**

A running toilet can waste hundreds of gallons of water daily. The culprit is usually a faulty flapper valve that doesn’t seal properly. Sometimes, adjusting the float or replacing worn-out parts can solve the problem. If the issue continues, a plumber may need to inspect the system for deeper issues.

### 4. **Low Water Pressure**

Low water pressure can be caused by mineral buildup in pipes, leaks, or issues with the municipal water supply. If only one fixture is affected, cleaning the aerator may resolve the problem. If the entire house experiences low pressure, it’s best to call a professional to diagnose and fix the issue.

### 5. **Leaky Pipes**

Leaks can lead to water damage, mold growth, and increased water bills. Common causes include corrosion, high water pressure, or weakened pipe joints. While temporary fixes like pipe tape or epoxy can help in emergencies, a permanent solution often requires replacing the affected section of the pipe.
